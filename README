This is a project to create an augmented reality clipboard.
It was built using Unity 2019.3.0f6 and AR Foundation 3
If you have the above Unity version installed, you can open the project in Unity. 
Choose Android in Build Settings, plug in your android device, then Build and Run
You may see some errors which require you to change settings, go to Build Settings > Player Settings > Android and change as appropriate
AR applications only work with ARCore enabled devices (See here: https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) and with Android 7.0 (Nougat) and later 

You need to print or display the provided GOSH-FULL-COLOUR logo (in the Assets folder) on a piece of paper or a screen.
When you point the device at the logo, the clipboard will appear.
If you want to change the trigger image, you can do so by editing the TrackedImageLibrary in the Unity Editor and dragging in a new image.

If you don't have Unity, you can build the provided apk onto an android device seperately.
This varies depending on device. More information can be found here: https://www.androidpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file#howto
